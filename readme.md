# RSS Feed Parser API
This is my approach to creating a REST API that allows users to submit any URL for an RSS feed. It parses the URL to extract links for all articles within it and returns a list of article titles and descriptions in JSON format.  The endpoint is protected using JWT authentication.

# Requirements

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up Firebase Admin SDK by placing your firebase-sdk.json file in the project directory using [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/):
    - Go to the Firebase Console.
    - Create a new project.
    - Go to Project settings > Service accounts.
    - Click "Generate new private key" and save the file

## Running the Application
Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

## Testing the application (Postman)
You can test the application using a tool like Postman or a browser for GET requests. I used postman, [screenshots](##Screenshots) are given below. 

1. Set Request URL and Method:
   - In Postman, set the request method to POST.
Enter the URL of your endpoint, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/parse-rss.
2. Add Authorization:
   - Go to the "Authorization" tab.
Select "Bearer Token" from the Type dropdown.
Paste your JWT token into the "Token" field.
   - Token is generated by running firebase_token_gen.html 
3. Set Request Body:
   - Go to the "Body" tab.
Select "raw" and choose "JSON" from the dropdown.
Enter the request url. For example:
```json
{
  "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa/rss"
}
```

Example Urls to test the API:
- "http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa/rss"
- "http://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/main"
- "http://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1003"
- "http://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1128"
- "http://globalnews.ca/politics/feed/"


## API Endpoints
### /parse-rss [POST]
- Description: Parses the RSS feed from the given URL.
- Headers: Authorization: Bearer [JWT Token]
- Body:
```json
{
  "url": "[RSS Feed URL]"
}
```
### /show-data [GET]
- Description: Displays the contents of the parsed RSS feeds.

## Database Schema
The SQLite database consists of two tables:

1.  __RSSFeed:__ Stores the RSS feed URLs and the last parsed time.
2. __Article:__ Stores the articles' titles and descriptions, linked to their respective RSS feeds.

## Screenshots
- Using postman returned the following JSON:

- Sample RSS feed result shown as a table in /show-data
